   # Thrift doesn't provide any way to list the would-be-generated files so

   # one has to track this manually.
   #
   # Here is the line-by-line description of what's going on:
   #
   # - depdb dyndep --dyn-target $dyndep_options --format lines --file $d
   #
   #   The dynamic dependency extraction builtin call. The --dyn-target option
   #   instructs it to extract dynamic targets. The --format=lines option
   #   tells it that the targets will be listed one per line.  The --file
   #   option tells it to read the dependency information (the list of
   #   targets) from the $d file that will be produced by the rest of
   #   the lines.
   #
   # - mkdir -p $t
   #
   #   Create the temporary directory. At the end of the command line, it will
   #   be automatically cleaned up.
   #
   # - $thrift -o $t $thrift_options $s &$t/gen-cpp/***
   #
   #   Generate the files placing them into gen-cpp subdirectory of the
   #   temporary directory $t. The &$t/gen-cpp/*** part is the cleanup
   #   that will $t/gen-cpp remove recursively.
   #
   # - find $t/gen-cpp -type f >$d
   #
   #   The find builtin lists all the files in the $t/gen-cpp directory
   #   and writes this list to $d.
   #
   # - sed -i -e "s%[/\\\\]$path.leaf($t)%%g"
   #
   #   The list of files produced by the find builtin will contain the
   #   temporary directory while the actual files that will be generated
   #   by the recipe body will be in out_base. So this sed script removed
   #   the temporary directory component from each path in $d.
